# MDD-DwC-mapping

The script employs mapping from MDD (Mammal Diversity Database) data model to DwC (https://dwc.tdwg.org/) standard, and updates and harmonizes various versions of MDD dataset to DwC format. Hierarchical information and synonyms were stored in custom format in MDD versions, which are now extracted and stored in DwC style using 'parentNameUsageID' and 'acceptedNameUsageID'. The synonyms are further classified into 'junior synonym' and 'senior synonym', and are highlighted in 'taxononomic status' column. Currently, the datasets contain individual rows only for species and genus level taxonomic rank.
